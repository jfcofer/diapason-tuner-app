## Goal

Real microphone in and real audio out on Android, through the `T-002a` engine, on the device this
project actually has: the **Redmi 23117RA68G** (Android 16, arm64). It is the "budget Android"
row of `TESTING.md` §7, where the fast path is most likely to be refused, which makes it the most
informative device to start on.

## Context

Read first: `docs/PLATFORM_AUDIO.md` in full. Parent: `T-002`. Depends on `T-002a`.

**Decide the binding first, on evidence, with an ADR.** The two candidates:

- the `oboe` crate: a C++ shim, ships `libc++_shared`, with an OpenSL ES fallback for API 26–27,
  where AAudio is unreliable. Check its maintenance status;
- AAudio directly via the `ndk` crate: pure Rust with no C++, but input presets need API 28+, and
  the pin is `minSdk 26` (`tools/versions.env`).

Measure the same things `T-001a` did: the symbols in the shipped `.so`, size delta, 16 KB
alignment, and that it **links**, not merely compiles. If the evidence says to raise `minSdk`,
that is its own task and its own ADR (`AGENTS.md` §8).

Emulator: fine for the permission and lifecycle rows. **Never** use it for latency or callback
timing; emulated audio says nothing about real devices.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] ADR for the Android audio binding, with the measurements above
- [ ] The Android backend passes the `T-002a` conformance suite (on device, via an integration
      test)
- [ ] Duplex: mic in and output out on one stream and one clock, on the Redmi
- [ ] Input preset per `PLATFORM_AUDIO.md` (Unprocessed if supported, else VoiceRecognition), and
      the preset *actually obtained* is reported
- [ ] `RECORD_AUDIO` in the manifest. The app manifest currently declares **no** permissions
- [ ] A real `MicrophonePermission` in `core_platform` behind the existing interface, covering
      denial and revocation-while-running. The metronome path is unaffected by denial
- [ ] Diagnostics overlay: sample rate, buffer size, round-trip latency, worst-case callback
      duration, xrun count, input preset
- [ ] Android rows of the `PLATFORM_AUDIO.md` §5 lifecycle matrix verified on device; automatable
      rows covered by an integration test
- [ ] Stream rebuilds off the RT thread on route change and device disconnect
- [ ] Round-trip latency on the Redmi recorded in the journal
- [ ] `just verify` green; `build-android` CI green

## Out of scope

iOS (`T-002c`). Pitch detection. Latency *calibration* UI (M5).
